# Boosting I-94 Traffic Efficiency: Key Influencing Factors

## Project Overview

This project explores the westbound traffic on I-94, specifically focusing on data collected by a station situated between Minneapolis and Saint Paul. The primary goal is to identify key indicators of heavy traffic, which include factors such as time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover patterns and trends that can enhance traffic management strategies for this particular stretch of highway.

## Key Questions Addressed

- What factors significantly influence heavy traffic on I-94 westbound?
- How do traffic patterns vary by time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions?

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Rows:** 48,204
- **Columns:** Includes traffic volume, weather conditions, and time-related features.

## Summary of Findings

- **Traffic Patterns:** Peak volumes are observed during morning and evening rush hours on business days, with lower volumes during nighttime and weekends.
- **Weather Influence:** Conditions like "Light rain and snow" and "Shower snow" are associated with higher traffic, although the overall impact is relatively weak.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis utilizes Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to:
- Examine summary statistics and distribution of traffic volume.
- Identify patterns related to time and weather conditions.
- Visualize findings through histograms, line plots, and correlation matrices.

## Results and Insights

The findings highlight distinct traffic patterns and potential weather-related impacts on traffic volume. The results are tailored to improving traffic management strategies specific to the westbound segment near the data collection station and should not be generalized to the entire I-94 highway.
