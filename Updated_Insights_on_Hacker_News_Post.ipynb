    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this data science project, we aim to analyze the engagement patterns of posts on the popular technology site Hacker News. Specifically, we will compare two distinct types of posts: \"Ask HN\" and \"Show HN.\" \"Ask HN\" posts are questions posed to the Hacker News community, while \"Show HN\" posts are used to showcase projects or interesting content. Our primary goal is to determine which type of post garners more comments on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal, we will analyze a dataset containing 20,000 submissions to Hacker News. We will filter the dataset to focus only on posts with titles that begin with either \"Ask HN\" or \"Show HN.\" By examining the number of comments each post receives, we will calculate and compare the average comment counts for both types of posts. Additionally, we will investigate whether the time of post creation influences the number of comments a post receives, providing insights into optimal posting times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis will reveal whether \"Ask HN\" or \"Show HN\" posts generate more community engagement in terms of comments. Furthermore, we will identify specific time frames that correlate with higher comment counts. These findings will offer valuable guidance for users looking to maximize the visibility and interaction of their posts on Hacker News."

    "# Summary of Analysis and Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we have examined a dataset of Hacker News posts to compare engagement metrics across different types of posts and times of day. The types of posts include \"Ask HN,\" \"Show HN,\" and other posts that do not fall into these categories. We focused on metrics such as the total number of comments, average comments per post, total points, and average points per post.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Post Type Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Post Types Examined:** We analyzed \"Ask HN\" and \"Show HN\" posts, along with general posts that were neither of these types.\n",
    "- **Key Findings:**\n",
    "  - **Ask HN Posts:** There are 1,744 \"Ask HN\" posts, which received a total of 24,483 comments, averaging about 14 comments per post.\n",
    "  - **Show HN Posts:** There are 1,162 \"Show HN\" posts, which received a total of 11,988 comments, averaging about 10 comments per post.\n",
    "  - **Other Posts:** A total of 17,194 other posts received 462,055 comments, averaging 27 comments per post.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Updates Made\n",
    "- **Function-Based Calculation:** We refactored the code to use functions for calculating statistics and finding the best times for posts. This approach improves code readability and reusability, ensuring that calculations are performed consistently and efficiently.\n",
    "- **Handling Warnings:** To address `SettingWithCopyWarning`, we used `.copy()` to create independent DataFrames for modifications. This prevents unintended side effects when modifying slices of the original DataFrame.\n",
    "- **Top Results Display:** We refined the output to display only the top 5 hours for comments and points. This makes the results more focused and easier to interpret, helping us identify the most impactful posting times.\n",
    "- **Data Transformation:** We converted the `created_at` column to a datetime format to enable more precise time-based analyses.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Code Functionality:** We streamlined the calculation and printing of statistics, ensuring more readable output with thousand separators.\n",
    "- **Visualizations:** Suggested adding visualizations such as histograms, box plots, line plots, pie charts, and heatmaps to better illustrate the findings and trends in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "These updates and insights provide a clearer understanding of the engagement patterns for different types of posts and help identify optimal posting times for maximizing community interaction and feedback."
